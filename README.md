# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification 
 [WIP] - This project aims to implement a convolutional neural network that detects, for a given MRI sample, if there's a brain tumor, in which case it should classify what type of cancer it is. This project will also include GAN implementation, to do some data augmentation, to increase the training set size.
